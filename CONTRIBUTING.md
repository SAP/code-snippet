# Contributing Guidelines

## Report an Issue

To report an issue please use the github issue tracker. Please try to make sure you have these in your issue:
* No duplicate
* Reproducible
* Good summary
* Well-documented
* Minimal example

## Issue handling process
When an issue is reported, a committer will look at it and either confirm it as a real issue (by giving the "in progress" label), close it if it is not an issue, or ask for more details. In-progress issues are then either assigned to a committer in GitHub, reported in our internal issue handling system, or left open as "contribution welcome" for easy or not urgent fixes.

An issue that is about a real bug is closed as soon as the fix is committed.

## Contribute Code
You are welcome to contribute code. PRs will be examined and if it fits the quality requirements and the roadmap of the product they will be merged.

## Individual Contributors
You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and agree to the Contributors License Agreement. This is common practice in all major Open Source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we are using [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) for individual contributions. CLA assistant is an open source tool that integrates with GitHub very well and enables a one-click-experience for accepting the CLA. For company contributers special rules apply. See the respective section below for details.

## Company Contributors
If employees of a company contribute code, in addition to the individual agreement above, there needs to be one company agreement submitted. This is mainly for the protection of the contributing employees.

A company representative authorized to do so needs to download, fill, and print the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](SAP_CCLA.pdf) form. Then either:

    * Scan it and e-mail it to opensource@sap.com
    * Fax it to: +49 6227 78-45813
    * Send it by traditional letter to: OSPO Core, Dietmar-Hopp-Allee 16, 69190 Walldorf, Germany

The form contains a list of employees who are authorized to contribute on behalf of your company. When this list changes, please let us know.
