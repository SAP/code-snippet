# Extension

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

## Running during development

Launch the WebSocket server configuration for development purposes. This will not launch vscode or a vscode extension, but still use Inquirer to run snippets and communicate with a locally served Vue application.

Launch the _Run Dev Server_ launch configuration.

Or use the command line:

```sh
# compile server code to out directory:
npm run compile
# run the websocket server:
npm run ws:run
```
